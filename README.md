# Chat-Application-Optimise-Branch
A chat application made with guizero, asymmetric encryption and sockets.

This is the optimise branch. 

The purpose of this branch is to achieve the following:
- Improve code quality by generalising logic used in code (threading queues, selection and iteration)
- Generalise where selection and iteration is used in threads, be it in functions or elsewhere
- Improve UX by elimininating overcomplicated factors such as unnecessary features. These features should be replaced in favour of a simplier experience for the user, 1 of the 3 main goals

In almost every case this branch should be held off from being merged as testing is still required.
