# Chat-Application-Dev-Branch
A chat application made with guizero, asymmetric encryption and sockets.

This is the developmental branch. 

The purpose of this branch is to achieve the following:
- Rename every variable with camelCase formatting unless it's a class
- Remove any use of global variables
- Add more functionality and features 
- Fix issues in the issues tab
- Develop without interfering with the stable build

In most cases this branch should be held off from being merged as testing is still required.
