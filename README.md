# Chat-Application
Chat app with guizero, asymmetric encryption and sockets.

When using the code, bare in mind there are input overrides on line428 that looks like

`#Override Inputs. Disable these for Proper functionality.`
`Host = '192.168.1.138'`
`PortInput.value = 3389`
`Color = "lightblue"`
`Username = "tomm"`
`PrivateKey = ["7347", "11269"]`.

Please indent or delete these when testing
